in these codes two sources are used: openweathermap and open meteo. Basically the files are designed for the city of Almaty, but this can be changed in the openweathermap and openmeteo files in the lines String city = "Almaty";. in the weatherdata file we change the data format from json responses to gson, and weatherapp displays the data we are interested in.
P.S. I still haven’t been able to clearly solve the problem with importing the json format, so most likely it won’t be possible to run this code, so I ask you to look at its integrity.
